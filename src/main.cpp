/**
 * @file main.cpp
 * @brief Process entry point.
 *
 * Responsibilities, in order:
 *   1. Force the Qt Quick Controls **Material** style (the whole UI is Material).
 *   2. Install the dual-sink categorized logging message handler.
 *   3. Construct the single ::Application (a QApplication so the tray + native
 *      OS file pickers work), which owns engine init + the QML module.
 *   4. Honor the single-instance guard, then hand off to the event loop.
 *
 * Everything is logged aggressively so a startup failure is diagnosable from
 * the very first line of the rotating log file.
