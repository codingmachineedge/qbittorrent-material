/**
 * @brief The one application object: engine bootstrap + QML host + lifetime owner.
 *
 * ::Application derives from @c QApplication (not @c QGuiApplication) because the
 * app needs a @c QSystemTrayIcon and the native OS file pickers — even though
 * every visible surface is Qt Quick / Material. It:
 *   - initializes the engine singletons (Preferences, BitTorrent::Session, …);
 *   - installs the runtime i18n translator (English / Cantonese / Bilingual)
 *     *before* the QML engine loads @c Main.qml (see CONTRACTS §2.3);
 *   - owns the app-scoped QML singletons that need a shared instance
 *     (::AppController, ::DesktopIntegration) and hands them out via their
 *     @c create() factories;
 *   - loads the @c qBittorrent QML module's @c Main entry point;
 *   - provides a single-instance guard.
 *
 * A process-wide accessor ::Application::instance() lets the QML singleton
 * factories reach the app-owned instances.
