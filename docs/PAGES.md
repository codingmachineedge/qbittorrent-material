# Documentation Site and Wiki

The project website is a dependency-free Material 3 application published directly from the repository's `master/docs` directory at:

<https://codingmachineedge.github.io/qbittorrent-material/>

It combines the landing page, screenshot gallery, complete technical corpus, and curated wiki in one installable static site. No server, analytics service, runtime package manager, or search API is required.

## Content model

Canonical content comes from:

- `README.md`
- every Markdown and JSON file under `docs`
- curated guides under `docs/wiki`

Run the deterministic generator after changing any source document:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\generate-pages-content.ps1
```

The command writes `docs/content.generated.js`. The generated bundle is committed intentionally: GitHub Pages can publish the directory as-is without a build workflow or Actions artifact.

## Local preview

Serve the `docs` directory over HTTP so service-worker and file-import behavior match production:

```powershell
py -3 -m http.server 4173 --directory docs
```

Then open <http://127.0.0.1:4173/>.

Opening `index.html` directly still renders the site, but browsers disable some PWA features for `file:` URLs.

## Search modes

The search engine indexes title, path, category, format, headings, and full body text for every embedded document.

- Plain-text search escapes regex syntax by default.
- Regex mode validates patterns and supports case, multiline, dot-all, and Unicode flags.
- Whole-word mode wraps the search expression in word boundaries.
- Filter rules target title, path, category, format, body, or every field.
- Rules combine with all/any logic and support negation.

The regex builder offers token insertion, sample-text testing, match highlighting, and capture-group inspection before applying a pattern.

Regular expressions run in disposable Web Workers so a pathological expression cannot freeze the page. Searches have a 1.2-second deadline, previews have a 600-millisecond deadline, patterns are limited to 320 characters, and preview text is capped at 200,000 characters. A timed-out worker is terminated and the next search starts in a fresh worker.

## Imports and exports

Markdown and text files can be imported as local wiki pages. A versioned wiki JSON bundle can contain multiple pages, while a search-profile JSON file stores the current query, options, and filter rules. Each source file is limited to 2 MB, stored document bodies are capped at 1 MB, and bundles accept at most 500 pages.

Imported documents are stored only in browser local storage. Rendering escapes raw HTML, rejects unsafe URL schemes, and blocks remote images from imported Markdown. GitHub project sites share the owner’s `github.io` browser origin, so other Pages applications under the same owner can technically access that origin storage; do not import secrets. Export before clearing browser storage or moving the workspace to another browser.

## GitHub Wiki synchronization

The separate GitHub Wiki repository is generated from the same canonical content:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\export-github-wiki.ps1 `
  -WikiWorkingTree ..\qbittorrent-material.wiki
```

The exporter writes curated pages, complete references, JSON blueprints rendered as code, navigation, branding, and screenshots. Commit and push those changes from the Wiki repository after review.

## Publishing

GitHub Pages uses `master` and `/docs` as its source. This branch-based configuration keeps the published site auditable without a repository-maintained Pages upload workflow. GitHub may create a short-lived internal `github-pages` artifact during deployment; the installer workflow removes completed Actions artifacts at the end of every run, so none are retained.

The site includes `.nojekyll`, a web manifest, an offline service worker, project-root-aware `404.html`, and linked sitemap metadata. Pages refreshes automatically after `master` changes.
